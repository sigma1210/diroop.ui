    <p class="lead">json schema templates in angular applications</p>
    <p>
      JSON schema is a standard that allows the annotation and validation of JSON Documents.
      <a href="http://json-schema.org/">http://json-schema.org/</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      diroop tools provides a collections of Javascript utilities that allow a developer
      to define and package schemas within an Angular module.
      Developers may design there own schemas using tools such as Altova's Xmlspy
      <a href="https://www.altova.com/download-json-schema-editor.html">ttps://www.altova.com/download-json-schema-editor.html</a> or the can choose from many predefined schemas.
    </p>
    <p>
        With the publication of the draft 4 of the json schema,
        <a href="http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema">http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema</a>,
          a json schema can be broken  into smaller manageable and reusable fragments.
          The developer needs a tool to facilitate including  and referencing these fragments within their javascript applications with out the need to expanding the schemas by hand.
    <p>
    <p>
        diroop.tools solves this by providing a schema cache that work in a similar way to the $templateCache provided by angular.
        Developers can package these schemas within there application without need to request them through a http request at run time.
